"I would LOVE IT if Harlem Grown could put together some guidelines for people in other urban spaces interested in starting something similar, based on what Tony and Neveah’s mom and the other volunteers learned along the way.

"I love this story so much! Offering these children an alternative that brings them nutrition with purpose. You have shown them how much of a difference one person can make in their community, and how consistent dedication and hard work can produce abundant results. God bless you and your beautiful sidekick, Niveah, and all who help with your incredible mission❣️",2021-08-15T21:02:13.000Z,,3,0,facebook
"Connecting people, particularly children, to actual food and where it comes from  It's a beautiful thing that will pay dividends inshallah 
 For the rest of their lives. Poor people are forced to live in food deserts, Where big Macs are plentiful  but real food, not so much. One more facet of systematic racism.

"I'm struck by the goal you ""announced"" to the principal the first time you walked into the school.  You've modeled resilience and lifelong learning, and admitting that it was ok to not know everything to these kids, as well as healthy risk taking.

"As a nutrition educator for a non profit in Santa Fe , New Mexico, Cooking with Kids , this story makes my heart sing. Also, as a gardener, we don’t realize how many kids get excited about learning where food comes from. It’s like magic making. Once we grow the food, my role as a nutrition educator is to gather the kiddos in the classroom kitchen, learn how to read a recipe, teach cooking techniques, equipment etc, real hands on learning with peers where we eat together around the table and trying nutritious foods from many cultures. We never force to eat but maybe try..the kids support each other. Changing lives one child at a time…🥰",2021-08-15T20:17:36.000Z,,21,8,facebook

"Not only did you clean out and plant seeds in that garden… you did it in the minds of these children as well. 

the best thing that you can give a child is your time… an ear… some encouragement… you can easily become their hero… and they can also become yours.

Awesome 👏. Yes we so need these vegetable gardens instead of fast food chains. And it’s nice to involve kids so they know how much effort goes into growing a single grain of food. So they value food too and reduce wastage.,2021-08-15T19:59:34.000Z,,5,0,facebook
